## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* As shown below, there are two variables, along with the intercept, that demonstrate a non-random variance on the mpg in our dataset, vehicle_lentgh and ground_clearance.  This can be determined by observing the "Pr(>|t|)" value which represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.  The smaller the value, the greater the likelyhood that the corresponding variable plays a role in the variance of the mpg.
* As shown below, the linear regression summary returned a p-value of 5.35 x 10^(-11) which is lower than even an extreme level of significance, therefore the slope of the linear model is not zero, and the null hypothesis should be rejected.  This can be used to assume there is some correlation between the variables and mpg that is subject to more than just random chance.
