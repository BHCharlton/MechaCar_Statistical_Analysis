## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* non-random
* As shown below, the linear regression summary returned a p-value of 5.35 x 10^(-11) which is lower than even an extreme level of significance, therefore the slope of the linear model is not zero, and the null hypothesis should be rejected.  This can be used to assume there is some correlation between the variables and mpg that is subject to more than just random chance.
